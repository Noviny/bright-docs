# Contributing to Parcel/Brisk integration

1. After cloning this repo, run `yarn && bolt`.
2. Clone a recent copy of [Parcel 2 (typically the `v2` branch)](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/v2)
3. Since [`yarn link` does not currently work with scoped packages](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5083), manually create symlinks
   from brisk to parcel.
   1. cd into the root of the parcel repository and run `pwd`
   2. In brisk's root run `yarn link:parcel <output of pwd` - this will set up the symlinks for you.

3a. Alternatively, you can use [link-monorepos-badly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/link-monorepos-badly) by following its documentation.

4. In the Parcel repo, perform a build with `yarn build`. **Any changes to Parcel source will require a build to be reflected**.
5. `cd` to `packages/website` in the Brisk repo, and run the demo site with `yarn dev`
6. Load the entry page by navigating to `http://localhost:3001`
