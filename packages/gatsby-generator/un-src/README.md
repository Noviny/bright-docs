# What is this?

Codebase cleanliness thing:

Currently preconstruct is building a bunch of things, but we have these weird
other files that we aren't building. We want to stop publishing src entirely
so we are putting them here in the interrim.

This should be refactored out, but we don't have time for that right now as we
need to get these things working, so here we are.
