# Mrs Bennet's guide to securing a stay at Netherfield Park

One sure fire technique for turning a short visit into a long stay is to begin your journey to
Netherfield on horseback just before it rains. Upon your arrival the good Mr Bingley will be
compelled to allow you to stay until the weather clears. You may catch a terrible cold, but it will
be worth it.
