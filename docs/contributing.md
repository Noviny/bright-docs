# Contributing

First off, thank you for contributing!

Make sure you read the [getting started](./getting-started.md) guide.

## Submitting a PR

In a PR we expect:

- tests to demonstrate your change.
- a changeset to document your change (run `bolt changeset` and it will walk you through making a changeset). If you want to know more about changesets, read the documentation on our [release process](./release-process.md)
