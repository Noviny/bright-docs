# Brisk's Goal

> Build the best tool to document multi-package repositories

Brisk aims to meet this goal by understanding package information from multi-package repositories, as well as creating a consistent formula of docs, examples, changelogs, meta which they work to.

Brisk also draws clear lines and supports a distinction between system documentation and package documentation.
