Improve the experience of nav:

- Removed a lot of the padding on each nesting, making the content much more legible
- Moved title to be in-line with how nav titles are meant to be, leading to reduction of space-usage
- For folders with only one child, merge the folder and child, removing a thousand levels of nesting
